        What started off as a college project WeatherTop is a labor of love and one that I am proud to share with you. While I've done my best to ensure a seamless user experience, it's possible that a few bugs may slip through the cracks. Rest assured that I'm continually working to improve the app, and your feedback is invaluable to me. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to contact me at any time @ wyneybanez@gmail.com. I appreciate your support and hope you enjoy using WeatherTop.
